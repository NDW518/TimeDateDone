# time_date_done

TimeDateDone is a simple, non-overwhelming way for users to work with time. The Time Calculator allows for quick and easy calculations of past and future dates, and the Calendar is a much more minimalistic version of the crowded, hard to read calendars on the app store today.

Please note that this is an unfinished project.
